<h1>Infographics</h1>

Infographics have become increasingly popular in the display of information. This was my first infographic project and I loved working on it. Specifically, this project was to convey the importance of Consumer Focus's web services to small businesses. I converted researched information about the topic into information graphics hoping to make them eye catching and easy to understand.   <br><br>
